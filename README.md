Hey there!

Welcome to the Teamwork API code samples repo  ðŸ˜€

Here we have some code samples which will guide you to creating integrations using Teamworks API's. These are here to support out API Documentation which can be found [here](https://developer.teamwork.com).

These are a mixture of samples from developers within Teamwork along with 3rd party developers who have reached out to us. 

If you see anything that you think needs updating, or you have created something which you think would help others, please create a pull request. 
We will be happy to review and add anything that will help others out!
